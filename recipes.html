        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <h2>The Perfect Burger</h2>
        <span>Origin: USA,</span>

        <p>Bobby Flay's perfect burger recipe.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground chuck (80 percent lean) or ground turkey (90 percent lean)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>4 slices cheese (optional)</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns, split; toasted, if desired</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol class = "steps">
            <li>Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a gas grill to high or heat coals in a charcoal grill until they glow bright orange and ash over. Brush the burgers with the oil. Grill the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with cheese; see step 3) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese, if using, to the tops of the burgers during the last minute of cooking and top with a basting cover, close the grill cover, or tent the burgers with aluminum foil to melt the cheese.</li> 
            <li>Sandwich the hot burgers between the buns and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
