        <p>In Bobby Flay's perfect burger recipe, the culinary maestro elevates the art of burger crafting to new heights. With a harmonious blend of premium ground beef, meticulously selected seasonings, and the expert touch of grilling mastery, each bite promises a symphony of flavors that transcends the ordinary, making it a gastronomic experience that lingers in the memory long after the last savory morsel is savored.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li><span>1.</span>1 1/2 pounds ground chuck (80 percent lean) or ground turkey (90 percent lean)</li>
            <li><span>2.</span>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li><span>3.</span>1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil</li>

            <li><span>5.</span>4 hamburger buns, split; toasted, if desired</li>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol class = "steps">
            <li><span>1.</span>Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><span>2.</span>Heat a gas grill to high or heat coals in a charcoal grill until they glow bright orange and ash over. Brush the burgers with the oil. Grill the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with cheese; see step 3) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side.</li>
            <li><span>3.</span>Add the cheese, if using, to the tops of the burgers during the last minute of cooking and top with a basting cover, close the grill cover, or tent the burgers with aluminum foil to melt the cheese.</li> 
            <li><span>4.</span>Sandwich the hot burgers between the buns and serve immediately.</li>
