            <p>Candy was Queen Elizabeth's longest living dog companion. Candy was a mix between dashound and welsh corgi. She sadly passed just one week before Queen Elizabeth's passing at 18 years old, but she stood firmly by the queens side during her royal life. </p> 
            <P>Candy was one of the many Pembrooke Welsh Corgi's to accompany Queen Elizabeth during her reign. Queen Elizabath was known for loving corgis and had two by her side as she passed. Those two, Sandy and Muick, were passed down to the Duke and Duchess of York after the queen's passing.</P>
