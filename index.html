            <img src="images/corgi_queen.webp" width = "400" alt="Small Welsh Corgi approaching a sitting Queen Elizabeth">

            <p>Candy was Queen Elizabeth's longest living dog companion. Candy was a mix between dashound and welsh corgi. She sadly passed just one week before Queen Elizabeth's passing at 18 years old, but she stood firmly by the queens side during her royal life. </p> 
            <P>Candy was one of the many Pembrooke Welsh Corgi's to accompany Queen Elizabeth during her reign. Queen Elizabath was known for loving corgis and had two by her side as she passed. Those two, Sandy and Muick, were passed down to the Duke and Duchess of York after the queen's passing.</P>

                <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
    
                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
